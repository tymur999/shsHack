**Salvage**

Salvage is a site designed to target and eliminate appliance and tool waste across the globe. Often people need a tool or appliance that they'll only ever use once, leading to millions in wasted material every year.

Salvage combats this by providing an easy to use interface to let you find people nearby who are renting out the items you wish to use. Simply login, fill out a quick information form, and begin renting out items!

**Tech**

Salvage was built with React JS and Firebase, allowing it to update in real time. Additionally, all user data is securely stored on the cloud and backed up, guaranteeing an almost perfect uptime on the site
